# Automated Data Profiling App

## 📘 Project Overview
The **Automated Data Profiling App** is a Streamlit-based web application that enables users to perform quick and comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on sample datasets.  
It leverages **pandas**, **seaborn**, and **ydata-profiling** to automatically generate detailed data profiling reports — all within an interactive web interface.

Users can select from built-in datasets like *Iris*, *Tips*, and *Penguins* to instantly explore distributions, correlations, and summary statistics without writing any code.
